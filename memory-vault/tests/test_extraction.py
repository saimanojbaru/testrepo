"""
Unit tests for the spaCy extractor.

These tests run against the real `en_core_web_sm` model (installed in
Dockerfile.test), so they verify actual NER output rather than mocked
behavior. That's intentional — the extractor's value IS what spaCy
produces, so mocking would test the mock, not the code.
